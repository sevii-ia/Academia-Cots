					<p>People are attracted to computing for different reasons. Some enjoy the logic of writing software programmes. Others thrive on the intellectual and technical challenge of designing digital electronic devices and systems to fulfill particular needs.<br><br>Your own interests may lie in troubleshooting large-scale computer networks; creating websites for online businesses; or working in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence. Whatever your ambitions, computing is likely to stretch you far beyond programming, requiring an appreciation of related areas, such as databases, engineering, information management, human-computer interaction, and mathematics.<br><br>Whether you’re an existing computing professional, the OU offers a wide choice of exciting course options to help you develop broad-based computing expertise, as well as valuable communication and team-working skills. Courses combining theory and practice cover a variety of topics, from understanding the basics of hardware and software, to learning how to program in Java and getting a computer to do exactly what you want it to do.</p>
